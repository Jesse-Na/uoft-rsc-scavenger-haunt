### Verify your installation
Let's create a simple program that prints out "Hello World!" to verify if everything is properly installed.

A few things to note:
1. We'll be coding in Python which means that all of our files need to end in **.py**.
2. `print` is an example of a *function*. You can easily tell because there are parentheses () immediately after its name.
3. Inside `print`'s parentheses, we gave it the data "Hello World!" There are many types of data, this data is called a *string*, string as in a string of letters or characters.
4. Functions are like machines, `print` is a function that takes input and outputs it to the screen, kind of like how a printer takes a digital document and prints it onto a page.

### Installing packages
A package in Python is a bundle of code someone else wrote. We use packages to avoid having to reinvent the wheel. Python comes with a lot of pre-installed packages, but for this class
we will need to install two packages ourselves called `pygame` and `pyserial`. They will help us make our game!
